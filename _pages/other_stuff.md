I am a native of Bengaluru (ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು), Karnataka, India. Other than mathematics, I like to play sports, do some fictional writing, and videography. I am a novice in playing the _Saraswati Veena_, an Indian stringed instrument mainly used in Carnatic classical music.

Sports
------
* I am part of the Sandlot Baseball team [West Waste Philly](https://www.facebook.com/westphillywaste/).
* I played cricket since highschool, and recently I was part of the team at IISER Bhopal.
* I play tennis occasionally. First started playing in IISER, thanks to [Shreyas](https://samagashreyas.github.io/).
