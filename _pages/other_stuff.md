About Me
---------

I am a native of Bengaluru (ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು), Karnataka, India. Other than doing math, I like to play sports, do some fictional writing, watch movies, and take videos. I am a beginner in playing the [Saraswati Veena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati_veena), an Indian stringed instrument mainly used in [Carnatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music#:~:text=Carnatic%20music%2C%20known%20as%20Karn%C4%81%E1%B9%ADaka,Kerala%2C%20Tamil%20Nadu%20and%20Telangana.) classical music.

I am part of the Sandlot Baseball team [West Philly Waste](https://www.facebook.com/westphillywaste/). I have been playing Cricket since high school.
I occasionally play Tennis. I first started playing Tennis at IISER, thanks to [Shreyas](https://samagashreyas.github.io/).
