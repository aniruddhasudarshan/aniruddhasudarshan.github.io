I am a native of Bengaluru (ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು), Karnataka, India. Other than mathematics, I like to play sports, do some fictional writing, watch movies, and do some videography. I am a novice in playing the _Saraswati Veena_, an Indian stringed instrument mainly used in Carnatic classical music.

Sports
------
* I am part of the Sandlot Baseball team [West Philly Waste](https://www.facebook.com/westphillywaste/).
* I have been playing Cricket since high school. I was part of the team at IISER Bhopal.
* I play Tennis occasionally. I first started playing Tennis at IISER, thanks to [Shreyas](https://samagashreyas.github.io/).
