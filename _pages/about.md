I am a second year Ph.D student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.temple.edu/) at Temple University, Philadelphia. My advisor is [Jackie Lang](https://math.temple.edu/~tuo02012/). I am mainly interested in Algebraic number theory. More specifically, I work with Galois representations and modular forms. Currently, I am reading about Ribet's method (for constructing non-trivial extensions of characters) and its arithemtical applications. 

I am from Bengaluru (ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು), Karnataka, India. Other than mathematics, I like to play sports (cricket, tennis, and, more recently, baseball), do some fictional writing, and music. I am a novice in playing Veena, an Indian stringed instrument, mainly used in Carnatic music.
