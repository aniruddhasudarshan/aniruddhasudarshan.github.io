I am a third year Ph.D student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.temple.edu/) at Temple University, Philadelphia. I am advised by [Jaclyn Lang](https://math.temple.edu/~tuo02012/). My interests lie in Algebraic Number Theory. More specifically, I work with Galois representations, elliptic curves, and modular forms. Currently, I am thinking about Ribet's method (for constructing non-trivial extensions of representations) and its arithemtical applications.
